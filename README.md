# **Species Models Shiny App**
App demonstrates three different species-related concepts in ecology 

## Summary
This shiny app contains three mini-apps related to ecological concepts: island biogeography, species-area relationships, and rarefaction. In the island biogeography mini-app, the user can visualize colonization/extinction rates versus island richness and island richness versus time plots using common scenarios or by specifying parameters and initial conditions. In the species-area relationships mini-app, the user can visualize these relationships according to the two most common functions (i.e., power function, semi-log model) by specifying inputs and applying these models to real-world data. Finally, in the last mini-app on rarefaction, inputs can be adjusted to see how well species accumulation and rarefaction curves fit actual biological data.
